# MUSALL

Welcome to the repository for MUSALL, the shared ownership platform, totally on chain on the IC as designed by Dfinity:

## Short Summary

The music industry is broken, in terms of musician earnings and autonomy. Contracts are often not fair and transparent toward musicians. Additionally only a hand-full of persons are able to invest in musicians and their art. The shared-ownership model implemented by MUSALL aims to lower the barrier to entry for musicians to create art, as well fans / investors to fund such art. Fans of music are insentivised to consume said art and earn in the process. MUSALL equals shared-ownership, but results in shared profits for all. Hence MUSALL.
